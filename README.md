### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile:Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to see what spots are available and to release their occupied spot in Map view. 
- Story: Students would have a better parking experience giving amount of parking fee their paid each month
- Market: Any school district company could utilize this app to regulate parking. 
- Habit: Depending on the timing, the users could open the app multiple times per day and create content in this app.
- Scope:V1 would allow users check avaible parking space and release it once they are done. V2 would develope better algorithms or detecting bots method to prevent any irregulations.
